# Taskbar Flash Killer and Test

This program is designed to sit in the background and listen for Taskbar Flash messages. When it detects such a message, it immediately asks Windows to stop the flash.

As far as I can tell on my machine, this process does not require UAC elevation.

I have bundled a release (zipped up) at the root, or if you'd like to tweak the code feel free to submit a PR.
